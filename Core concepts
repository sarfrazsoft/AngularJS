AngularJS extends HTML with new attributes.

First, you will learn the basics of AngularJS: directives, expressions, filters, modules, and controllers.

Then you will learn everything else you need to know about AngularJS:

Events, DOM, Forms, Input, Validation, Http, and more.

AngularJS is a JavaScript framework. It can be added to an HTML page with a <script> tag.
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>

AngularJS extends HTML attributes with Directives, and binds data to HTML with Expressions.

AngularJS extends HTML with ng-directives.

The ng-app directive defines an AngularJS application.

The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.

The ng-bind directive binds application data to the HTML view.

<div ng-app="">
  <p>Name: <input type="text" ng-model="name"></p>
  <p ng-bind="name"></p>
</div>

AngularJS starts automatically when the web page has loaded.

The ng-app directive tells AngularJS that the <div> element is the "owner" of an AngularJS application.

The ng-model directive binds the value of the input field to the application variable name.

The ng-bind directive binds the content of the <p> element to the application variable name.

AngularJS directives are HTML attributes with an ng prefix.

The ng-init directive initializes AngularJS application variables.

<div ng-app="" ng-init="firstName='John'">
<p>The name is <span ng-bind="firstName"></span></p>
</div>

You can use data-ng-, instead of ng-, if you want to make your page HTML valid.

AngularJS expressions are written inside double braces: {{ expression }}.

AngularJS modules define AngularJS applications.
AngularJS controllers control AngularJS applications.
The ng-app directive defines the application, the ng-controller directive defines the controller.

<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">

First Name: <input type="text" ng-model="firstName"><br>
Last Name: <input type="text" ng-model="lastName"><br>
<br>
Full Name: {{firstName + " " + lastName}}

</div>

<script>
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
  $scope.firstName= "John";
  $scope.lastName= "Doe";
});
</script>
